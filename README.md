# NTRU-Signatures for Vanets and IoVs

Creating a novel and robust NTRU-based signature scheme for Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) or the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) involves understanding both the NTRU cryptosystem and the specific security and performance requirements of vehicular networks. Here's a high-level outline of how such an algorithm might be structured:

## 1. Introduction to NTRU
NTRU is a lattice-based cryptosystem known for its efficiency and resistance to quantum attacks. It involves operations over polynomial rings and is used for both encryption and digital signatures.

## 2. Requirements for VANETs/IoVs
VANETs/IoVs have specific needs:
1. **High-speed communication:** Fast signature generation and verification.
2. **Security:** Resistance to common attacks, including quantum attacks.
3. **Scalability:** Ability to handle a large number of vehicles.
4.  **Low overhead:** Minimal impact on bandwidth and computational resources.

- _Signature Verification_

## 4. Algorithm Design
   ### Key Generation

-   Select parameters ℕ as a prime number, *p*, and *q* such that *p*
    and *q* are relatively prime and *q* is significantly larger than
    *p* thus, (*q* \> *p*).

-   Generate private keys *f* and *g* from a polynomial ring
    ℤ\[*x*\]/(*x*<sup>*N*</sup> − 1) s.t *f* is an invertible modulo of
    *q* and *p*.

-   Compute the public key *h* as
    *h* = *p* ⋅ (*g* \* *f*<sup>−1</sup> mod  *q*)

### Signature Generation

-   To sign a message *m*, hash the message to a polynomial *μ* in
    ℤ\[*x*\]/(*x*<sup>*N*</sup> − 1).

-   Compute the signature *s* as:
    *s* = (*f* ⋅ *μ* + *r*) mod  *q*  where *r* is a random polynomial with small coefficients.

### Signature Verification

-   Verify the signature *σ* by computing:
    *μ*′ = (*h* ⋅ *s* mod  *q*) mod  *p*

-   Check if  *μ*′ = *Hash*(*m*), thusly (Check if *μ*′ matches the hash of the original message (*m*)).
    
## 5. Security Considerations
* Ensure the choice of ℕ, *p*, and *q* and provide a sufficient security level against known attacks.
*  Implement proper random polynomial generation to avoid side-channel attacks.
*  Utilize secure hash functions for hashing the message.

## 6. Performance Optimization
* Optimize polynomial multiplication using FFT or similar techniques.
* Minimize the size of keys and signatures to reduce bandwidth usage.
* Use efficient algorithms for polynomial inversion.

## Conclusion
This example provides a starting point for constructing an NTRU-based signature algorithm tailored for VANETs/IoVs. For practical deployment, further refinement, testing, and optimization are necessary to ensure security and efficiency in real-world scenarios.
